This project was developed during the spring semester of 2022 at the University of the Incarnate Word. This project is based on the idea of a company, Game Kingdom, who hosts a website using Amazon Web Services to act as repository for game files. Our project makes use of AWS S3 for file and site hosting as well as AWS CloudWatch which keeps track of user metrics.

Files were intend to run on an S3 bucket. Website coding belongs to Vimm's Lair. Download links have been removed for protection of the copyright holders.

This project was undertaken by Anthony Jamieson, Joseph Drouillard and Bryanna Parkoff.
